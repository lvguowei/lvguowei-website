      <description>If you are a Linux person and you want to follow the awesome Hand Made Hero, here are how I am doing it(on Arch Linux).
 Install VirtualBox. Create a Windows virtual machine(at least Win7 + SP1, you can download a ISO image from here), pay attention to the hard drive size, 25G is too small, increase it to like 50G at least. In order to make the full scren mode work, we have to install something called Guest Addition.</description>

      <description>I purchased the pre-order Hand Made Hero game. I think it&amp;rsquo;s great value for learning, there is this super awesome guy who has tons of experience talking to you at least 1 hour per day for over a year. And it cost only $15. I must have lost my mind if I missed this.
Two interesting observations:
 This guy is against OOP This guy prefers C to C++  This kind of &amp;ldquo;against C++ and OOP and all kind of complex nonsense shit&amp;rdquo; thing (this and this) hit me several times and I really like to know about their argument.</description>
