      <description>There is this stereotype impression about technology industry, that it is a cruel game only for energetic and ambitious young men, when you get old, you will be kicked out mercilessly.
This doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me so much since I was still young a few years ago, but since now I am getting older it starts to act as a background noise that grabbed me more and more attention.
Is this the truth?</description>
