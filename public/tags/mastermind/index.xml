      <description>In one of Uncle Bob&amp;rsquo;s video, he talked about this game called &amp;ldquo;Master Mind&amp;rdquo; when he was teaching Single Responsibility Principle(SRP). After googled the game, turns out that it is actually a quite famous board game. For more information about the game, please look here -&amp;gt; wiki.
The game can be played by two people. One comes up with a code, the other one tries to guess. The one who comes up with the code has to score the guesser&amp;rsquo;s guess based on some rules.</description>
