It all started from a message sent by my cousin in our family group chat one day.

He posted some of those harder 24 problems, and I couldn't solve any of them.

(If you don't know what is this 24 game is all about, here you can read it https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_game)


So, I decided to write a program to help me. And that program turned into a mobile game eventually.

You can find it on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.guowei.twentyfourgame). It's free.

Enjoy!
