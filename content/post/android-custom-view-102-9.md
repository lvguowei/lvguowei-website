There is nothing new here, just another exercise.

Two things to be careful with:

1. Try to call `validate()` as fewer times as possible, it is expensive.
2. If you want to handle the touch events in this manner, remember to return `true` from `onTouchEvent()`. Otherwise, only the first event will be triggered(most likely DOWN in this case) and not the succeeding ones (like the MOVES).
