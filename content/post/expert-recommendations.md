I'm so terribly bored at seeing people recommending Clean Code, Code Complete and such classic computer science books. Not that they are not good, they are very good and definitely worth reading. BUT, I want more! The old ones, weird ones, funny ones.

I happen to know two famous people who seem to enjoy writing stuff like this.


**[Fogus](http://www.fogus.me/)**.

He is the author of [The Joy of Clojure](https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-clojure-second-edition)


**[Catonmat](https://catonmat.net/about)**

He has [100 books](https://catonmat.net/top-100-books-part-one) to recommend.


Btw, I just bought this book from random online bookstore  browsing.

P.S. The cover is too beautiful to resist. Don't you agree?
