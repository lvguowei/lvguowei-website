I'm brushing up my C now using the book [C Programming - A Modern Approach](https://amzn.to/2XPAxwf) by K.N.King.

{{< img-post "/img" "c-modern-approach.jpg" "C Programming A Modern Approach" "right" >}}

I have the classic K&R book, I do not recommend it. I just find it very hard to read, no matter if you are a novice or a veteran.

After some googling on people's recommendations, I got the K.N.King book. I'm glad that I did. Very easy to read, has a good set of exercises and programming projects. It is one of those programming books that read well, I mean not dry at all and to the point at the same time.

I'm now doing the programming projects in the book: [github](https://github.com/lvguowei/c-programming-a-modern-approach). You can also find answers from the [author's website](http://knking.com/books/c2/answers/index.html). There is some interesting content on that website, for example [this](http://knking.com/recbooks/index.html).
