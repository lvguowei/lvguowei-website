I just discovered this online book shop [BetterWorldBooks](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/).
They have a pretty good computer books selection, and some of them are dirt cheap. So I made two orders today.

No shipping fee, plus I also caught the last day of Spring discount. :>

Highly recommended!
