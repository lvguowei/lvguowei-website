This post is the beginning of *Chapter 15 Towards a Real User Interface*.

## Replacing JLabel

We decided to replace the simple label with a table to represent snipers. To play it safe, we make a baby step: create a one cell table to just replace the text label.

## Sending the State out of the Sniper

In the new `JTable`, we show 3 columns: `itemId`, `lastPrice` and `lastBid`. Since these 3 values aways go together, we can bundle them up into a `SniperState`.

Recap: `AuctionSniper` is a listener in `AuctionMessageTranslator`. When there is a **PRICE** message coming, the `currentPrice(int price, int increment, PriceSource priceSource)` will be called.
So the `lastPrice` can be taken directly from `price`, the `lastBid` can be calculated by `price + increment`, what about the `itemId`? We decided to put it in the `AuctionSniper`'s constructor, since `Main` knows which item we are bidding, we can pass it to create the `AuctionSniper`. Also we change the tests.

## Showing a Bidding Sniper

In order to show the `SniperState` on UI, we pass it to the `SnipersTableModel` and use it to show in the table. Nothing really interesting here.
