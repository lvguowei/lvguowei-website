This whole video is in Q&A form, which is quite enjoyable to watch.

I strongly agree with Linus in the following thoughts:

1. **Passion**, **hard work** and  **attention to details** are extremely important. Whether you have vision or not is totally another story.
2. People who easily get offended, **should be** offended.
