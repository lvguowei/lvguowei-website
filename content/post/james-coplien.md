I do not remember how I find this guy on Youtube but BOY, my world is not the same.

I just link two of his talks here from Youtube. You can certainly find more.

I'm also interested in what books he would recommend to programmers. Here is the list of books he named in the interview with [Developers On Fire](https://developeronfire.com/podcast/episode-123-james-coplien-concern-for-the-human-being).

I then go on to find what books he wrote. But in general they are not very well received. I wonder why.

P.S. He later commented under the second talk about all the books he mentioned, here is the list:

Certification is useless:
