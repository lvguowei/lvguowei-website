{{< figure src="/img/pw.jpg" >}}

I got this book from a secondhand book store online. And it is the 1st edition published in 1987, the year I was born.

I have only 2 things to say about this book.

1. It teachs you how to tell a great manager from a not so great one.
2. Almost always peopleware wins over software.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who want to peek into the world of managers.

P.S. I have heard from two reliable places that Christopher Alexander is an god-like figure and his books are worth reading. Just make a memo here.
