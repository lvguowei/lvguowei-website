In this post, let me show you why you do not need **for** and **while** and all the other looping structures at all in your language.

First, this is an excerpt from the book:

>... As a consequence, these languages(Ada, Pascal and C) can describe iterative processes only by resorting to special-purpose "looping constructs", such as **do**, **repeat**, **until**, **for**, and **while**. The implementation of Scheme ... does not share this defect. ...
