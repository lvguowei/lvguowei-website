The Espresso testing framework really makes it easy to write UI tests for Android. In this first installment, I will go through how to set it up and write our first test case.

Let's get started.

## Set up Espresso

Add the following dependencies to your gradle build file.

{{< highlight groovy >}}

dependencies {
    // Other dependencies ...
    androidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.2.2'
}

## Understand the Rules in JUnit

### Why do they exist?

We all know that in JUnit there is a setup method(annotated as @Before) and a teardown method(annotated as @After). They will run before and after each test respectively. This handles simple senarios pretty well, but it has 2 drawbacks:

1. They are two separate thing, it is very easy to do the setup work but forget to do the clean up work, what makes this worse is that if you forget to clean up, *this* test won't fail, *other* test may fail. So it becomes very hard to track things down when tests are failing.

2. Let's imagine that there are some code for setting up and tearing down the database in database tests, and there are some other code for setting up and tearing down the file handle in the file system tests. Now, what if we want to write tests that involves both file system and the database? Since we are smart, of course we create a `FileSystemAndDatabaseBaseTests` that handles both. Well, what if we want to then write tests that involves both database and networking? Should we create another base class called `DatabaseAndNetworkingBaseTests`? This certainly doesn't scale, soon we will end up with piles upon piles of inheritance classes, because the setup and tear down works can not compose nicely. This is essentially a classic *prefer composing over inheritance* case.

So a `Rule` is basically aiming to solve these problems.

### How JUnit works internally

In order to understand `Rules` better, let's first look at how JUnit works on a higher level.

Tests are annotated by `@Test`, so that JUnit can convert them into some small classes called `Statement`.

{{< figure src="/img/test-to-statement.png" >}}

The `Statement` is a very simple class:

{{< highlight java >}}

public abstract class Statement {
    /**
     * Run the action, throwing a {@code Throwable} if anything goes wrong.
     */
    public abstract void evaluate() throws Throwable;
}

{{< /highlight >}}

This `Statement` is actually an empty base class with only one method. Looks a lot like a [Command Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern), huh? 

So we can say that JUnit goes through all the functions annotated with `@Test`, create a bunch of command objects(Statements), and then execute them by calling `evaluate()`.

### What is a Rule

Now we have a basic understanding of how JUnit creates test objects and then execute them, we can talk about where `Rule` kicks in.

A `Rule` is a kind of *function* (notice that in Java, since function is not first class citizen, is normally represented by an Interface), that takes a `Statement` in, and returns a `Statement` back.

{{< figure src="/img/rule.png" >}}

Now let's take a look at the code:

{{< highlight java >}}
public interface TestRule {

/**
     * Modifies the method-running {@link Statement} to implement this
     * test-running rule.
     *
     * @param base The {@link Statement} to be modified
     * @param description A {@link Description} of the test implemented in {@code base}
     * @return a new statement, which may be the same as {@code base},
     *         a wrapper around {@code base}, or a completely new Statement.
     */
    Statement apply(Statement base, Description description);
}

{{< /highlight >}}

From the comments we can probably guess that this is a [Decorator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern). It provides a way to do extra work before or after the original test, aka a single place to do both `before` and `after` work. And the best part is that it is even composable like this:

{{< figure src="/img/rules-chain.png" >}}

To understand this better, let's implement a Rule.

{{< highlight java >}}
public class SampleRule implement TestRule {
    public Statement apply(final Statement s, Description d) {
        return new Statement() {
            public void evaluate() throws Exception {
                // do more before test run here
                s.evaluate();
                // do more after test run here
            }
        }
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

In the sample code, we have now a place to very easily put in extra logic before and after the test run.

## Add the activity test rule

{{< highlight java>}}
@Rule
public ActivityTestRule<MainActivity> rule = new ActivityTestRule<>(MainActivity.class);
{{</highlight>}}

This rule basically launches and specified activity before test, and destroy it after test, so we don't have to set this up ourselves.

## A simple test case
Now we can start writing our first test case, which is as simple as checking some string is displayed.

{{< highlight java>}}
@Test
public void shouldBeAbleToLaunchMainScreen() {
    onView(withText("Hello World")).check(ViewAssertions.matches(isDisplayed()));
}
{{</highlight>}}

There are 3 parts for every espresso test: `onView`, `perform` and `check`. `onView` makes sure that the view is on the screen before we proceed with the test. `perform` allows simulating some user input on the view, and `check` is checking the final state the view is in.

There is a [cheat sheet](https://google.github.io/android-testing-support-library/docs/espresso/cheatsheet/) that is quite useful.
