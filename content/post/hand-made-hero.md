I purchased the pre-order Hand Made Hero game. I think it's great value for learning, there is this super awesome guy who has tons of experience talking to you at least 1 hour per day for over a year. And it cost only $15. I must have lost my mind if I missed this.

Two interesting observations:

1. This guy is against OOP
2. This guy prefers C to C++

This kind of "against C++ and OOP and all kind of complex nonsense shit" thing ([this](http://jonathanwhiting.com/writing/blog/games_in_c) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&t=2399s)) hit me several times and I really like to know about their argument.
