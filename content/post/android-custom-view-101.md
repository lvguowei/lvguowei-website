Creating your own custom android views can be useful and daunting at the same time. For a long time there is nobody really talks about it in a approachable way, until this lady [Huyen Tue Dao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLl0ovmta6A). Let's try to follow her approach and create some custom view!

In this part, we will create a very simple timer view that takes up the whole screen and display the current time.

So let's get started.

First thing first. There are 3 steps that views go through before they appear on the screen:

1. **Measure** | onMeasure()
2. **Layout**  | onLayout()
3. **Draw**    | onDraw()

During the **measure** phase, the parent gives its children a set of constriants, and the children dicide how big they want to be within those constriants.

During the **layout** phase, each parent determines the final position and size of its children.

Once the **measure** and **layout** phases are complete, the parent will draw itself and request its children to do the same.

In this post, we will create a timer view that displays the time like a digital watch.

First, create a **TimerView** class that extends the android **View** class.

In it, we need to provide 2 custructors.

{{< highlight java >}}
// This custructor is used when the TimerView gets created programatically
public TimerView(Context context) { ... }

// This custructor is used when the TimerView gets created through xml
public TimerView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) { ... }
{{< /highlight >}}


In order to draw stuff, we need something called `Paint`.

{{< highlight java >}}
// Paint for drawing background
backgroundPaint = new Paint();
backgroundPaint.setColor(Color.parseColor("#880000"));

// Paint for drawing text
numberPaint = new TextPaint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG);
numberPaint.setColor(ContextCompat.getColor(getContext(), android.R.color.white));
{{< /highlight >}}

Important things to keep in mind: **Drawing operations are in pixels, but you should think in Density Independent Pixels (DP) or Scaled Pixels (SP)**, that means whenever you pass in the pixel value, you need to multiply that by **display density**, `DPs/SPs * display density`.

So if we want the text to *64sp*, we can do like this:

{{< highlight java >}}
numberPaint.setTextSize(64f * getResources().getDisplayMetrics().scaledDensity);
{{< /highlight >}}

Next we get the center point and radius of the background circle:

{{< highlight java >}}

// The circle will be in the center of the canvas
int canvasWidth = canvas.getWidth();
int canvasHeight = canvas.getHeight();

float centerX = Math.round(canvasWidth * 0.5f);
float centerY = Math.round(canvasHeight * 0.5f);

float radius = (canvasWidth < canvasHeight ? canvasWidth : canvasHeight) * 0.5f;
{{< /highlight >}}

For drawing text, the origin is the left bottom of the text. So we have to calculate the x and y offsets like this:

{{< highlight java >}}

String text = formatter.format(time);
float textOffsetX = numberPaint.measureText(text) * -0.5f;
// for some reason the ascent is negative
float textOffsetY = numberPaint.getFontMetrics().ascent * -0.4f;
{{< /highlight >}}

Now we can draw the circle background and text:

{{< highlight java >}}

canvas.drawCircle(centerX, centerY, radius, backgroundPaint);
canvas.drawText(text, centerX + textOffsetX , centerY + textOffsetY , numberPaint);

{{< /highlight >}}

This completes the Part I, we have the timer view taken up the whole screen. In next part, we will take a look at how to properly implement `onMeasure()` so that it behaves better if is put inside some parent view.
