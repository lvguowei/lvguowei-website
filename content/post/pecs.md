>You: Master, I heard this PECS in the JAVA world. But I'm deeply puzzled by it.

>Master: Do you know what it stands for?

>You: *Producer Extends Consumer Super*?

>Master: In order to understand it, you shall stop thinking about what these words mean, it's not helpful at all. Just follow my questions.

>You: Yes, Master. Please start.


>Master: There are **plants**, then there are **fruits**, then there are **apples** and **pears**. They form a hierarchy.

>You: Apples and pears are fruits, and all fruits are also plants. Right?

>Master: Correct.

>You: I think there are also plants other than fruits, like **grass**?

>Master: You are right. Keep that in mind for now.

>You: ...

# ROUND 1

>Master: (Pointing at a basket on the table) What is this?

>You: A basket.

>Master: Correct. Simply a basket. No more no less.

>You: ...

>Master: Pay attention to my words now carefully. I tell you now that this is a **fruit basket**.

>You: OK, so it has **fruits** in it then. What fruits I wonder?

>Master: Asorted fruits, not important.

>You: ...

>Master: Now I tell you that **all fruits are edible**.

>You: ...

>Master: Answer me. Do you think you can take anything from the basket with you eyes closed, and eat it?

>You: Yes, I can.

>Master: Now let's change the setting. If I now tell you that this is a **plant basket**. Do you think you can still do the above task?

>You: No, I may get **grass**, which is not tasty I guess.

>Master: ...



# ROUND 2

>Master: (Still pointing at the basket) Now I tell you this is a **fruit basket**.

>You: ...

>Master: Suppose you have an **apple**, are you feeling comfortable putting it in the basket?

>You: Totally.

>Master: Suppose you have an **pear** instead, are you feeling comfortable putting it in the basket?

>You: Sure.

>Master: OK. Now I tell you that this is not a fruits basket, but a **plant basket**. Are you now feeling comfortable putting you **apple** or **pear** in it?

>You: Yes, I am. Apples and pears are also plants anyway.

>Master: You are right. Now let's again change the setting. I tell you now that this is a **apples basket**. And you have a **pear** in your hand. Are you feeling comfortable putting it in the basket?

>You: ... Not sure I want to put a pear into a basket that is full of apples.

>Master: OK. We are done here.

>You: (feeling enlightened)

*THE END*
