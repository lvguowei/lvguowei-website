Finally I finished the 27th video on the famous *Programming Paradigms* course by Stanford. It's excellent!

It basically covers:

1. C programming.
2. Functional programming (using Scheme).

Jerry is an excellent teacher! Thank you for putting up the material online. Highly recommended for anyone!
