# Deva Premal & Miten

I'm naturally attracted to the religious music since I was very young, maybe under 10 years old.

Deva Premal is one of the best that I can find in this genre that is also easy to be enjoyed by a normal person.

And when I traveled to Malaga in Spain, I listened to her songs all the time, and since it is a place near the Arab world, somehow it fit perfectly.

Listening to her concert while applying some attar from [antonymarmin](https://anthonymarmin.com/), and  I'm in heaven.
