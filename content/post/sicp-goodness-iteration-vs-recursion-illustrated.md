This is a light hearted post, there is no math no code and such, just some screenshots and music.

I took the following screenshots from the SICP video lecture lesson 1B, depicting the difference between iteration and recursion.

{{< figure src="/img/iteration.png" >}}

Here the GJS is the author, he wants to compute the sum of 3 and 4, but he is lazy, he will deligate it to the other person by writing him a note, with the number 3 and 4 and also his name so people knows who to give back at the end. But that person is also lazy, he did some work and changes the numbers to be 2 and 5 and passes it along. So on and so forth until the numbers on the paper becomes 0 and 7. Now whoever gets it knows how to compute, and return a number 7 to GJS.

Note 2 things:

1. There is only one paper note.
2. After his work is done, the person can just pass the note to the next person and be done with it and disappears.

In the recursion case,  GJS writes a note to Joe with numbers 3 and 4 and his name GJS. Joe now will write another note with numbers 2 and 4 and his name Joe, and pass it to Harry. But his work is not done yet, he need to wait Harry to tell him the result and remember to add 1 to it and then he can pass it back to GJS. You can see that this process involves more resources than the iterative approach. More notes and more people waiting.

The music in the beginning of each lecture sounds good. After some digging, I located it finally. It is **Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by J. S. Bach**. 

Enjoy.
