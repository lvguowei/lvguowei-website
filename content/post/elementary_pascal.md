{{< img-post "/img" "elementary_pascal.jpg" "Elementary Pascal" "center" >}}

I got this book a while ago.

I want to get 2 things out of this book:
1. Learn some basic Pascal in order to read the **Algorithms Plus Data Structures Equals Programs** by Niklaus Wirth.
2. Find some entry level programming teaching material that I can use to teach my kid to program.
