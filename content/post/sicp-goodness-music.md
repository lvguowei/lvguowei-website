>Do you think Computer Science **equals** building websites and mobile apps? 

>Are you feeling that you are doing **repetitive** and **not so intelligent** work?

>Are you feeling a bit **sick** about **reading manuals** and **copy-pasting** code and keep **poking around** until it works **all day long**? 

>Do you want to understand the **soul** of **Computer Science**?

>If yes, **read SICP!!!**

The music in the beginning of each lecture is beautiful. After some digging, I located it finally. It is **Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by J. S. Bach**. 

Enjoy.
