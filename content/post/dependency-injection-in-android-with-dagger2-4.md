Let's look at the `PresentationComponent` more closely.

One strange thing is that `PresentationModule` has `ActivityComponent` as its dependency, and it `@Provide` all the objects provided by `ActivityComponent` already.

This is rather ugly, can we do something about it?

The answer is **Component Dependencies**.

The idea is that we can make `PresentationComponent` depends on `ActivityComponent`. That way, `PresentationComponent` automatically gets access to all the objects exposed by `ActivityComponent`.

After this change, it looks like this:
