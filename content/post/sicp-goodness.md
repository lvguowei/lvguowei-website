This is the first post of this **SICP Goodness** series, in which I discuss some of my own findings from reading the book SICP.

Today's topic is about two ways to perform evaluation of the program: **Applicative Order** and **Normal Order**.

Let's put here the example from the book.

First, let's define some functions to calculate sum of squares of two numbers.

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum-of-squares x y)
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
  
(define (f a)
  (sum-of-squares (+ a 1) (* a 2)))
