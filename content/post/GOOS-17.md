>This is a series of blog posts going through the great book [**Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests**](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627), typing in code chapter by chapter, trying to add some of my own understanding where things may not be easy to grasp in the book. I highly recommand you get a copy of the book and follow along with me. Happy coding.

This post covers *Chapter 18 Filling in the Details*.
