This is the beginning of Chapter 13 in the book.

Well, we have a problem about `Main`.

Let's see what `Main` is currently doing for us. 

1. It handles UI work.
2. It handles connection to XMPP server.
3. It implements `AuctionEventListener`. That is `AuctionMessageTranslator` uses it as a listener.

Among the 3 resposibilities, the 3rd one feels not quite right. As the types of messages grows, `Main` will have to do more and more stuff.

Now it is time to create a `AuctionSniper` class to make `Main`'s life easier. Now thinking about it, it is quite weird that there is no  class named after *sniper* since our application is call **auction sniper**. Let's also create a `SniperListener` to put into `AuctionSniper`, so that `AuctionSniper` does not directly depend on UI.

Now the architecture looks like this:

Pay attention to this structure, something interesting is happening. The shaded components(*Chat* and *Main*) have been pushed to the sides. And what in the middle forms the core of our business logic of the app.
