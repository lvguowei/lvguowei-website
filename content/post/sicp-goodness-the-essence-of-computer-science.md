>Do you think Computer Science **equals** building websites and mobile apps? 

>Are you feeling that you are doing **repetitive** and **not so intelligent** work?

>Are you feeling a bit **sick** about **reading manuals** and **copy-pasting** code and keep **poking around** until it works **all day long**? 

>Do you want to understand the **soul** of **Computer Science**?

>If yes, **read SICP!!!**

The following text is from the preface to the first edition of SICP. The depth of the thinking and the vision of computer science in general are incredible.

(please ignore some spelling errors :P)
