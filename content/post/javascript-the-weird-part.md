[Javascript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/) is a great course. Highly recommended if you are getting into JS from other programming languages. Much better than the book [Javascript: the Good Parts](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742) in my opinion.

Here I distilled all the source code with comments from the videos, for the  impatients.
