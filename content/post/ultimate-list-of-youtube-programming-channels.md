Here are the Youtube channels I subscribe and recommend. They are in no particular order.

# [Computer History Museum](https://www.youtube.com/user/ComputerHistory)

I'm an old school programmer and this fits my taste perfectly well. Especially check out the **Oral Histories** section where they have in-depth interviews with the industry legends from top IT companies.

# [Confreaks](https://www.youtube.com/user/Confreaks)

Mainly about Ruby conference videos recordings, even though I don't know Ruby I still find some of their videos extremely helpful.

# [Voxxed Days](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFZ66zPdDvZ4KO3gkTduEig)

Another general purpose programming conference channel, the speakers there are quite good, like [Venkat Subramaniam](https://agiledeveloper.com/).

# [Douglas Schmidt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt-Wvc_ojTzGLpjhruIXYSw)

His Android and Design Pattern courses are the best. Also if you want to learn C++, check out his course [Intermediate Software Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkPyNpg4_x4&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4ZsvD10uXmClGnukcu3Uff).

# [Simple Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFxdcuY-S6yjZGq_2cjilHg)

He is the king of developer soft skills. Teaches you how to negotiate salary and be successful in your career. If you still think coding is the only thing you should be caring about, you need to check out his videos RIGHT NOW!

# [GOTO Conferences](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA)

Another good source of conference recordings. Created for developers, by developers.

# [Jared Bruni](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJSFxhYfux2GKdip60w-dA)

This guy has a very impressive programming books collection, I mainly watched his book collection videos for fun.

# [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA)

Explain complex computer science topics by experts in a fun way. Really to the point and also informative. Come on they have Prof **Brian Kernighan** for several episodes.

# [InfoQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQX1tChV7Z7l1LFF4L9j_g)

Yet another conference channel, their collection is truly impressive.

# [Clojure Pills](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH0CkLvbv6yEyrUnw9qujpQ)

One Clojure function each video. Watch it if you want to expand your Clojure toolbox.

# [Elysian Shadows](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRDU71BLWwww_NgT5VBGZYQ)

I think this is one of the first channels which is doing devlog for games. If you want to be an indie game developer, watch this video and see how hard you have to work! I pretty much enjoyed it.

# [FLOSS weekly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsGdWQMkl4Yv4fLBQ3aCC1Q)

Talks about open source projects. I think I watched the Emacs Org mode video more then 10 times, I love Carsten Dominik's accent so much.

The academic meme weirdo.

# [Bisqwit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKTehwyGCKF-b2wo0RKwrcg)

If you ask me which programmer I want to become one day, this is the answer. And he is from Helsinki, I might even took the bus he was driving when he was a bus driver. One last word about him, I understand NONE of his videos.

# [Eli the computer guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD4EOyXKjfDUhCI6jlOZZYQ)

His voice is gold. People pay him to rant.

# [Sacha Chua](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClT2UAbC6j7TqOWurVhkuHQ)
