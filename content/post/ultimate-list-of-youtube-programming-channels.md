Here are the Youtube channels I subscribe and recommend. They are in no particular order.

# [Computer History Museum](https://www.youtube.com/user/ComputerHistory)

{{< img-post "/img" "youtube-chm.png" "Computer History Museum" "center" >}}

I'm an old school programmer and this fits my taste perfectly well. Especially check out the **Oral Histories** section where they have in-depth interviews with the industry legends from top IT companies.

# [Confreaks](https://www.youtube.com/user/Confreaks)

{{< img-post "/img" "youtube-confreaks.png" "Confreaks" "center" >}}

Mainly about Ruby conference videos recordings, even though I don't know Ruby I still find some of their videos extremely helpful.

# [Voxxed Days](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFZ66zPdDvZ4KO3gkTduEig)

{{< img-post "/img" "youtube-voxxed.png" "Voxxed" "center" >}}

# [Douglas Schmidt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt-Wvc_ojTzGLpjhruIXYSw)

{{< img-post "/img" "youtube-douglas.png" "Douglas Schmidt" "center" >}}

His Android and Design Pattern courses are the best. Also if you want to learn C++, check out his course [Intermediate Software Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkPyNpg4_x4&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4ZsvD10uXmClGnukcu3Uff).

{{< img-post "/img" "youtube-sp.png" "Simple Programmer" "center" >}}

He is the king of developer soft skills. Teaches you how to negotiate salary and be successful in your career. If you still think coding is the only thing you should be caring about, you need to check out his videos RIGHT NOW!
