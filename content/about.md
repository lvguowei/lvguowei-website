{{< img-post "/img" "profile.jpg" "Guowei Lv" "center" >}}

My name is Guowei Lv. I'm a polyglot programmer. I mostly speak Java and Kotlin when I'm doing Android development and Clojure and ClojureScript when I'm doing web development. I will use C if I have time for making games :D

Programming is hard enough to often make people lose their minds. Calm down and think, be practical and sane.
